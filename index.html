        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>I am 25 years old, born in Mendoza, Argentina, but I hold dual citizenship as an 
                Argentine-Spanish citizen. I pursued a degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the 
                National University of Cuyo for six years and graduated in May 2024. Currently, I 
                am enrolled in a diploma program in Project Management further to enhance my skills
                and knowledge in this field.</p>
                <p>I have a passion for sports and have played rugby since I was 13 at Los Tordos 
                Rugby Club. Rugby has been a significant part of my life, helping to shape my 
                leadership abilities and teaching me the value of teamwork and collaboration. 
                My experiences in the field have been instrumental in developing my character and 
                approach to both professional and personal challenges.</p>
                <p>As an entrepreneur, I am always exploring new business opportunities. I am one 
                of the founders of MetaFila, an innovative app designed to manage the wait times 
                of commercial and non-commercial establishments in the metaverse. With MetaFila, 
                our goal is to streamline queue management, benefiting both users and establishments 
                by improving efficiency and customer satisfaction. In addition, I am part of the 
                founding team of Happy Home, a company focused on providing installation and 
                maintenance services for residential electrical systems and home automation. Our 
                mission at Happy Home is to create intelligent, secure, and efficient living spaces 
                for our clients.</p>
                <p>I consider myself a very active person with a strong desire to learn and grow. 
                I am a technology enthusiast, always looking for ways to leverage new advancements
                to improve comfort and well-being for people. My drive to innovate and my commitment 
                to excellence are the foundations of my professional journey, and I am dedicated to 
                making a positive impact through my work and ventures.</p>

                </div>
                <p>We developed an advanced remote control system for an anthropomorphic arm to improve 
                    human-robot interaction in industrial environments. This project carried out in collaboration with my 
                    colleague Agustín Sardi Bottino, addressed the need to provide more intuitive and natural control of robotic 
                    manipulators.</p>

                <p>The product combines computer vision and remote control technologies to allow operators to manipulate the 
                    robotic arm precisely and safely. We implemented a gesture capture system based on computer vision that 
                    translates the operator's movements into commands for the robotic arm. This innovative approach enhances 
                    the precision and ease of use of robotic control.</p>
                    
                <p>We developed robust control algorithms using Python and C++ programming to program the Blue Pill board, 
                    ensuring efficient and reliable operation of the robotic arm. Additionally, we created interactive training 
                    software using Unity, which simulates the work environment and facilitates the learning and practice of 
                    operators, allowing them to familiarize themselves with the system before using it in a real setting.</p>
                    
                <p>The anthropomorphic arm we assembled features high-quality mechanical and electronic components designed to 
                    withstand the demands of industrial operations. The final prototype integrated all the necessary hardware with 
                    the control software, achieving a cohesive and functional solution.</p>
                    
                <p>This remote control system represents a significant advancement in human-robot interaction, offering a powerful 
                    tool to improve efficiency and safety in various industrial applications. The combination of computer vision, 
                    advanced programming, and Unity simulation provides intuitive and precise handling, facilitating the work of 
                    operators and enhancing productivity in the industrial environment.</p>

                </div>
                <p>My 3D printer project is based on the renowned Prusa 3D model and operates using the 
                open-source Marlin firmware. This project incorporates several key technical specifications 
                and components for optimal performance. The printer's frame is constructed from MDF (medium-
                density fiberboard)</p>

                <p>At the core of the control system is an Arduino Mega, paired with a RAMPS 1.6 kit. The 
                Arduino Mega, known for its capacity and flexibility, runs the Marlin firmware, which is 
                highly popular in the 3D printing community for its reliability and customization options. 
                The RAMPS 1.6 kit facilitates the connection and control of stepper motors, heaters, and 
                temperature sensors, enabling efficient and precise management of all the printer's 
                components. This configuration ensures the printer can handle complex tasks and produce high
                -quality prints.</p>

                <p>The printer is designed to offer a 20 cm by 20 cm print area, which is suitable for a 
                wide range of projects, from small prototypes to larger, more detailed pieces. This generous
                print space, combined with the sturdy MDF frame and advanced control system based on the 
                Arduino Mega and RAMPS 1.6, makes this printer a powerful and versatile tool for any 3D 
                printing enthusiast. With these features, the printer is not only capable of producing 
                precise and detailed prints but also serves as an excellent platform for experimentation and
                learning in the field of 3D printing.</p>
